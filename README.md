# Image-Search-App
A web-based application for retrieving free high quality images using Unsplash API.

This application is made with React hooks and Redux by using Unsplash API.

If you want to run this application on your own, you have to generate your own Unsplash API access keys and add it to the accessKey.js file in the root directory.

The source code is bundled into the public directory with a custom webpack.config.js file (no react-create-app is used).

To kick start the project run npm init in order to install the required node modules.

- To run it in the development environment, use: npm run dev:server

- To run it in a production mode, use: npm run build:prod

- To run it on express server, use npm start
